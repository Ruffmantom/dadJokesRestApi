Whenever progressives launch a campaign ostensibly designed to benefit minorities, it is reasonable to assume that they have an alternate agenda, one that has nothing to do with those they say they are helping.\r\n\r\nOver the past few months, progressives politicians, leaders, pundits, and personalities have made a show of expressing solidarity with the black community in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers. These individuals are doing their best to persuade the nation, and especially black Americans, to believe they are working to effect real change in race relations. However, it seems that their efforts are lacking an essential component: solutions.",

Proponents on both sides of the contentious issue insist they are right and spout \u201Cfacts\u201D to back up their claims. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that so many Americans are torn, confused, and distrustful whenever so-called specialists open their mouths.\r\n\r\nThe media and local governments have done a bang-up job of terrifying citizens by threatening their certain death or that of Grandma Betty, who will surely die horribly because of their selfishness in not wearing a mask. And now it appears the conformists have added another big one to their list of accomplishments: The National Retail Federation (NRF) has successfully convinced leading retail chains to refuse service to maskless customers.",

What\u2019s the occasion?\r\nI\u2019m releasing a shoe, so I\u2019m gonna try to throw a party for it for all my friends.

The most effective method of readying your body for the rigors of the trail is consistent stretching.\r\nWe suggest stretching all of the main muscle groups used in hiking, but also pay attention to your particular needs, and take them into account. If you have weak ankles, make an extra effort to strengthen them. Same goes for calf muscles, tight hamstrings, and any other muscle group you may have issues with.\r\n\r\nFirst up: activating and strengthening your core. Having a strong core is imperative for successful hiking, and affects every other part of your body, from your back muscles, to posture, to flexibility in the legs.\r\n\r\nAccording to Popsugar, the core muscles consist of your abdomen, hips and lower back. Each of these groups plays an integral part in maintaining muscle health on the trail. Popular core stretches include child\u2019s pose, cobra, spine rotation, and more.",
