            "Artical":"If there is one thing the United States has learned over the past few months, it\u2019s that the progressive left never lets heightened racial tensions go to waste.\r\n\r\nAmericans should go by a particular rule of thumb when the far left champions the cause of black Americans. Whenever progressives launch a campaign ostensibly designed to benefit minorities, it is reasonable to assume that they have an alternate agenda, one that has nothing to do with those they say they are helping.\r\n\r\nOver the past few months, progressives politicians, leaders, pundits, and personalities have made a show of expressing solidarity with the black community in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers. These individuals are doing their best to persuade the nation, and especially black Americans, to believe they are working to effect real change in race relations. However, it seems that their efforts are lacking an essential component: solutions.",

            "Artical":"Among the greatest debates of 2020, ranking up there with the validity of controversial presidential election polls, is whether or not wearing a mask or face covering prevents the spread of COVID-19. Proponents on both sides of the contentious issue insist they are right and spout \u201Cfacts\u201D to back up their claims. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that so many Americans are torn, confused, and distrustful whenever so-called specialists open their mouths.\r\n\r\nThe media and local governments have done a bang-up job of terrifying citizens by threatening their certain death or that of Grandma Betty, who will surely die horribly because of their selfishness in not wearing a mask. And now it appears the conformists have added another big one to their list of accomplishments: The National Retail Federation (NRF) has successfully convinced leading retail chains to refuse service to maskless customers.",
